// -- USER CONFIGURATION
// =====================

//	!! -- READ THESE INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY -- !!
//
//    This is the user configuration file, where you'll be able to tweak select parts of the skin to
//    your liking. In order to make it as easy for the user as possible, this file has been broken
//    down into different sections, each with a user-friendly explanation on how to proceed.
//
//    FYI - Any line beginning with a double forward slash " // " denotes a comment - a line that Steam
//    essentially ignores. Uncommenting a line is simply done by deleting those 2 slashes at the start
//    of a line. Take your time to read through this file, and only edit a line when told to do so.
//
//    Once you're done, save this file and restart Steam.



   // Alternative Font (Recommended for XP Users)
   // ----------------
   // The font that this skin uses by default (Segoe WP) requires DirectWrite to be enabled.
   // Users of Vista (with the Platform Update installed) and Windows 7/8 can enable it on the
   // Interface tab in Steam's Settings. Older version of Windows, and anyone else not able
   // or willing to use DirectWrite, should preferably switch to Segoe UI.

// -- DOUBLE CHECKING
// ==================

//    Once you're done, an easy way to double check that nothing's out of place, is to make sure that
//    every line between here and "USER CONFIGURATION" begins with either a double forward slash "//"
//    or the word "include" (without the quotes). Spaces of any kind and blank lines are completely
//    irrelevant.
//
//    Remember that any modifications to Tweaks will not take effect until Steam has been restarted.



// -- HOW TO DISABLE A TWEAK?
// ==========================

//    To disable a tweak, simply add 2 forward slashes // in front of the "include" line, beneath the
//    tweak's explanation.
//
//    Alternatively, if all this is a bit too confusing, you can just replace this file with the one
//    from the .zip archive that you downloaded. That will, however, disable all tweaks and you'll
//    have to start from scratch to enable any.
